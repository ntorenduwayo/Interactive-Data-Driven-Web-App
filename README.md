# Interactive-Data-Driven-Web-App
## Project Overview 
After building a multiple regression linear model (see [Link] (https://github.com/ntorenduwayo/Prestige-Rating)), I launched the model on a website using Shiny (i.e., an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R.)  and Heroku (i.e., a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.). </br>
The website consists of 7 web pages:
-	Data
-	Data Summary
-	Distribution Plots
-	Correlation Heatmap
-	Model Summary
-	Response vs Predictors Relationship Plots
-	3D Model Visualization
This website tells and summarizes the multiple regression project story, and makes it more accessible to the wide web. </br>
